    <p id="thor-para">Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians,<br>
        a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.<br>
        Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as<br>
        Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,<br>
        which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms.<br>
        When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard<br>
        (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,<br>
        stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.<br>
        Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers,<br>
        "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</p>
